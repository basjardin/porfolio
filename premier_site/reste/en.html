  <h1>our story:</h1>

  <div>The ice cream truck story began in 1990 when my father wanted to start selling homemade ice cream near the Cathedral de Notre Dame in Rouen. Due to a lack of customers, my father had to stop the business. However, in 2017, I decided to revive my father's dream by offering additional services such as pastries and lottery.
